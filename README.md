# Pink Creature Zoo

This is a simple (yet large) Electron program that makes pink fictional characters wander around a grass field forever.

## Why

No reason. It can be a background desktop trinket I guess. More features might be added later to make this more than a digital paperweight. 

## Installation Instructions

Clone this repository and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

<br>

Open your system's terminal or command prompt and install Electron via the node package manager:
```bash
# MacOS/Linux/Windows
npm install --save-dev electron
```
(Note: make sure you are in the same directory as this project when you execute this command. Otherwise, delete the node_modules directory wherever you ran this.)

<br>

Lastly, run the program:
```bash
# MacOS/Linux/Windows
npm start
```
